# Google Cloud Storage - Default Flavor

## Overview

The `google_cloud_storage` intent with the `default` flavor provides declarative management of Google Cloud Storage resources. It enables teams to create and manage storage buckets and related configurations on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) through infrastructure as code. This flavor simplifies integration with GCP's storage services within automated deployment pipelines.

By using this intent, users can ensure consistent provisioning and management of cloud storage resources alongside their application and infrastructure code.

## Configurability

The schema defines the following core properties under the `spec` section:

- **title**  
  A descriptive name for the Google Cloud Storage resource.

- **description**  
  A detailed explanation of the storage resource's purpose and usage.

- **type**  
  Specifies the resource type, which is an object defining the storage configuration.

Additional advanced configuration options can be passed via the `advanced` block, allowing further customization as needed.

## Usage

This module is intended to manage Google Cloud Storage buckets and associated settings within GCP. It supports creation, updating, and deletion of storage resources in a declarative way.

Typical use cases include:

- Managing storage buckets for application data or backups.  
- Integrating storage provisioning in CI/CD pipelines for automated deployments.  
- Maintaining consistent storage configurations across multiple GCP projects or environments.

By defining storage resources as code, teams gain improved control, repeatability, and auditing for their cloud storage infrastructure.
