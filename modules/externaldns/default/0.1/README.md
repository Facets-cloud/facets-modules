# ExternalDNS - Default Flavor

## Overview

The `externaldns` intent with the `default` flavor enables automated DNS management for cloud environments. It integrates with multiple cloud providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, and Kubernetes to dynamically update DNS records based on service changes. This helps maintain accurate and up-to-date DNS mappings for workloads.

It supports common DNS providers and automates routing configurations for applications, reducing manual DNS updates and operational overhead.

## Configurability

Main configuration options under the `spec` section include:

- **provider**  
  Specifies the DNS provider, such as `aws`, `gcp`, or `azure`.

- **domains**  
  A list of domain names that ExternalDNS will manage and update.

- **aws**  
  Configuration block specific to AWS provider settings (can be empty or customized).

Additional provider-specific options can be included for advanced setups.

## Usage

This module automates DNS record management for cloud-native applications. Typical use cases include:

- Automatically updating DNS records when services change IPs or endpoints.  
- Managing DNS for multiple domains in hybrid or multi-cloud setups.  
- Ensuring service discovery and traffic routing remain accurate without manual intervention.

It streamlines DNS operations and supports scalable cloud infrastructure deployments.
