# Service  â€“ CronJob Flavor (v0.1)

## Overview

The CronJob flavor of the Service module enables scheduled task execution across cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, GCP, and Kubernetes. It offers a unified approach to defining periodic or recurring jobs using container images as execution units. This is particularly useful for automating tasks like database cleanups, report generation, or data synchronization.

By standardizing how schedules, retries, and runtime behavior are defined, it ensures consistent and reliable job execution in any supported environment.

## Configurability

This module offers structured controls across three main areas:

- **Scheduling**: Uses standard cron syntax to define when jobs run. Execution can be paused without removing the configuration by enabling suspension. Concurrency policies determine how overlapping executions are handled, whether allowed, blocked, or replaced.

- **Retries**: Defines how many attempts should be made before considering the job failed. Built-in validation ensures values remain within acceptable limits, minimizing misconfiguration.

- **Runtime Overrides**: Users can override default commands or supply arguments, offering flexibility in how the container behaves at runtime. These settings allow reuse of generic images for various job types.

Additionally, it supports environment-scoped deployment using metadata fields like namespace, and integrates seamlessly with artifact pipelines that supply the container image to run.

## Usage

This module fits naturally into CI/CD or GitOps workflows for managing scheduled jobs declaratively. Once configured, it enables consistent job execution without requiring manual intervention.

Teams can version control job definitions, toggle suspension for safe rollout, and deploy the same logic across clouds without changes. Runtime logs and retry behaviors can be observed through native monitoring tools, providing full transparency into job health.

By separating scheduling logic from infrastructure, the CronJob flavor helps reduce complexity and enforces reliability for all time-based workloads.
