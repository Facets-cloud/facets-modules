# AlloyDB for PostgreSQL Module

## Overview

The AlloyDB module provisions and manages PostgreSQL databases on Google Cloudâ€™s AlloyDB. It supports declarative configuration of PostgreSQL clusters with customizable instance sizing, versioning, additional database creation, and schema management. Designed for enterprise-grade workloads, it enables high availability, scalability, and cloud-native performance optimization.

## Configurability

- **PostgreSQL versioning**: Choose from supported versions (`12.11`, `13.3`, `14.0`) to match application requirements.  
- **Instance sizing**: Define compute capacity for writer and reader nodes with fine-grained control over CPU cores.  
- **Reader scaling**: Specify the number of reader replicas (up to 10) for read scalability.  
- **Multiple databases**: Provision multiple named databases during setup via a comma-separated list.  
- **Custom schemas**: Define and organize database schemas mapped to specific databases.  
- **Schema validation**: Enforced naming conventions and pattern validations ensure reliable deployments.

## Usage

This module allows teams to deploy AlloyDB clusters on GCP with production-ready configurations and strong control over resource allocation and data organization.

Common use cases:

- Provisioning AlloyDB clusters for transactional and analytical workloads  
- Scaling read-heavy workloads with multiple reader replicas  
- Organizing logical database boundaries with schemas  
- Automating GCP-native PostgreSQL deployment in CI/CD pipelines  
- Managing PostgreSQL at scale with infrastructure-as-code
