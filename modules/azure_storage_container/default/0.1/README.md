# Azure Storage Container Module

## Overview

The Azure Storage Container module provisions and manages blob storage containers within Azure Storage Accounts. It provides a declarative configuration interface to create secure, scalable, and cost-efficient storage buckets for unstructured data. This module is ideal for storing application logs, media files, backups, and other large datasets in Azure-native environments.

## Configurability

- **Declarative provisioning**: Define Azure blob storage containers as infrastructure-as-code for consistent deployments.  
- **Cloud-native integration**: Leverages Azure Storage Account capabilities for high availability and global scalability.  
- **Extensible specification**: Designed to support future enhancements like access control, versioning, lifecycle rules, and encryption.  
- **Modular design**: Can be composed with other Azure modules for building complete data and compute stacks.

## Usage

This module is useful for teams looking to automate the creation of Azure Storage containers within CI/CD pipelines or infrastructure management systems.

Common use cases:

- Storing large volumes of binary or log data  
- Supporting media streaming, backup, or archive scenarios  
- Integrating with serverless functions or microservices that need blob access  
- Managing data isolation across dev, staging, and production environments  
- Automating Azure resource provisioning via GitOps workflows
