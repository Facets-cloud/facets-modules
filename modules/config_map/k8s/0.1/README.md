# Kubernetes ConfigMap Module (v0.1)

## Overview

The ConfigMap module manages Kubernetes ConfigMaps across multiple cloud environments including GCP, AWS, Azure, and native Kubernetes clusters. It allows declarative creation and management of ConfigMaps to store configuration data such as certificates, environment variables, or other key-value pairs needed by applications running inside Kubernetes pods.

## Configurability

- **Multi-cloud support**: Seamlessly deploy ConfigMaps in Kubernetes clusters running on GCP, AWS, Azure, or on-premises.  
- **Flexible data storage**: Store arbitrary configuration data in key-value pairs, including multiline values like certificates and scripts.  
- **Kubernetes-native**: Integrates directly with Kubernetes APIs, leveraging native ConfigMap resources.  
- **YAML-based specification**: Define ConfigMap contents declaratively for version control and automation.  

## Usage

This module is ideal for teams and operators who need to:

- Manage application configuration data and secrets (non-sensitive) in Kubernetes  
- Store SSL/TLS certificates or other multiline config data securely in ConfigMaps  
- Use declarative infrastructure-as-code practices for managing Kubernetes configuration  
- Enable consistent and repeatable ConfigMap deployment across multiple clusters and clouds  

Common use cases:

- Providing SSL certificates to ingress controllers or services  
- Injecting configuration files or environment variables into pods  
- Sharing configuration between multiple microservices  
- Centralizing configuration management in Kubernetes CI/CD pipelines
