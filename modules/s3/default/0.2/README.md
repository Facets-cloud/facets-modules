# AWS S3 Module

## Overview

The AWS S3 module provides integration with Amazon S3 within the Facets Cloud platform. It enables the creation, management, and import of S3 buckets and their associated policies using a declarative configuration. This module is designed for applications requiring scalable, durable, and cost-effective object storage.

## Functionality

- **Bucket Creation**: Automatically provisions S3 buckets with specified configurations.
- **Resource Import**: Supports importing existing S3 buckets and bucket policies into the Facets-managed environment.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Enables the definition of object lifecycle rules, including expiration and transition between storage classes.
- **Versioning Support**: Allows configuration of rules for managing noncurrent versions of objects.
- **Storage Optimization**: Facilitates cost savings by transitioning data to different storage classes based on access patterns.

## Configurability

- **Imports S3 bucket**: Specify an existing S3 bucket to import into the Facets platform.  
- **Imports S3 bucket policy**: Optionally import the associated bucket policy for finer access control.  
- **Lifecycle rules**: Define expiration and transition rules for managing object storage lifecycle.  
- **Versioning**: Configure handling of noncurrent object versions, including expiration and transitions.  
- **Multipart uploads**: Set rules to automatically abort incomplete multipart uploads after a defined period.
