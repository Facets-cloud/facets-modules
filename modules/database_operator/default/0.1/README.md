# Database Operator Module (default flavor)

## Overview

The Database Operator module installs and manages database operators within Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud providers, including AWS, GCP, Azure, and native Kubernetes environments. It enables declarative deployment and management of database operators with configurable resource limits and customizable Helm chart values. This module is designed to streamline database lifecycle operations such as provisioning, scaling, and backups in cloud-agnostic Kubernetes environments.

## Configurability

- **Multi-cloud support**: Compatible with Kubernetes clusters running on AWS, GCP, Azure, or on-premises Kubernetes.  
- **Resource sizing**: Configure CPU and memory limits for the operator pod with fine-grained controls ensuring optimal resource allocation.  
- **Custom Helm values**: Pass arbitrary YAML-formatted values to customize the underlying Helm chart deployment according to specific operational requirements.  
- **Kubernetes cluster integration**: Requires detailed Kubernetes cluster information to target the operator installation precisely.  

## Usage

This module is suitable for teams looking to deploy database operators in Kubernetes environments across diverse cloud platforms with control over resource consumption and deployment customization.

Common use cases:

- Deploying a database operator for lifecycle management of databases inside Kubernetes  
- Adjusting CPU and memory limits to meet cluster resource availability and operator workload  
- Providing custom Helm values to tailor operator configurations beyond defaults  
- Enabling multi-cloud Kubernetes deployments with consistent operator management
